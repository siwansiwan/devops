# SSH_CONFIG example# David Sanabria, 2017-01-24## This is an example of a personal SSH config file. You need to add this# file to the ssh root directory on your computer, which is typically found in your# home directory (e.g. ~/.ssh/config). You can learn more from the command line by # typing "man ssh_config" from your terminal (*nix) or from my blog entry on this topic# at http://bit.ly/2jX2GQr (Wordpress).# # You can safely delete every line in this example gist that starts with the "#" comment# character.## Using this approach allows you to connect to your target server using the following# simple command (you can use SFTP this way too!):# #        EASY! -->   ssh dev-app-svr## Rather than the harder way of of specifying everything on the command line##        HARD! --> ssh -i ~/.ssh/king-julian-development king-julian@192.168.10.75# # The entry below will allow you to connect to your hypothetical application server in# your development environment. This example assumes the following:#    1. Your target server is 192.168.10.75#    2. Your username on the server is "king-julian"#    3. You have created an SSH keypair specifically for use in your development server#       (always a good practice), and named the keypair "king-julian-development" (private)#       and king-kulian-development.pub (public key)#    4. You have already added the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the target server.# Example Host EntryHost dev-app-svr    # Target Server and port number    Hostname 192.0.10.0    Port 22        # Your Credentials    User king-julian    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/king-julian-development        # These commands make sure that your connection doesn't hang if you get    # disconnected, and also keep sending traffic so that your server doesn't    # think you're just an idle connection.        ServerAliveInterval 30    ServerAliveCountMax 3    TCPKeepAlive yes    Host dev-fb    # Target Server and port number    Hostname 1.1.1.1.1    Port 22        # Your Credentials    User ssiwan    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/siwan        # These commands make sure that your connection doesn't hang if you get    # disconnected, and also keep sending traffic so that your server doesn't    # think you're just an idle connection.        ServerAliveInterval 30    ServerAliveCountMax 3    TCPKeepAlive yesHost dev-nves    # Target Server and port number    Hostname 1.1.1.1    Port 22        # Your Credentials    User ssiwan    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssiwan-test.pem        # These commands make sure that your connection doesn't hang if you get    # disconnected, and also keep sending traffic so that your server doesn't    # think you're just an idle connection.        ServerAliveInterval 30    ServerAliveCountMax 3    TCPKeepAlive yesHost man-ansible    # Target Server and port number    Hostname 1.1.1.1.1    Port 22        # Your Credentials    User ssiwan    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssiwan        # These commands make sure that your connection doesn't hang if you get    # disconnected, and also keep sending traffic so that your server doesn't    # think you're just an idle connection.        ServerAliveInterval 30    ServerAliveCountMax 3    TCPKeepAlive yesHost man-jenkins    # Target Server and port number    Hostname 1.11.1.1.1    Port 22        # Your Credentials    User ssiwan    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssiwan        # These commands make sure that your connection doesn't hang if you get    # disconnected, and also keep sending traffic so that your server doesn't    # think you're just an idle connection.        ServerAliveInterval 30    ServerAliveCountMax 3    TCPKeepAlive yes# Bonus for reading this far! Here is a command that will easily list all of your config entries# in case you forget them:##      grep ~/.ssh/config -e 'Host ' | awk '{print $2}'#
